## Description

Refactoring had to be done on this HTML and CSS file in order to improve accesibility and make the website more optimal for search engines. 
I was motivated to see if I can apply the knowledge I have so far and to make the code easier to read and follow. 
I've learnt semantic elements in this project along with how to use them and their importance.
